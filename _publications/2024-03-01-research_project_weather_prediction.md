During this project, we adapted an LSTM network and a CNN network to temporal sequences. After a theoretical and practical approach to LSTM, we compared its results with those from standard machine learning methods (random forests, XGBoost,...). We then turned to the interpretability and simplification of our model, an important step in ensuring the reliability of our predictions.
