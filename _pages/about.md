<div style="text-align: justify;">
After completing a Master's in Applied Mathematics at <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/">Ecole polytechnique (France)</a> as part of the engineer curriculum (X2021), I'm now in my final year of my graduate degree in Mathematics, Vision and Learning (<a href="https://www.master-mva.com/">MVA program</a>) at the <a href="https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/accueil-english/">Paris-Saclay University</a>.
<br><br>
I have a very strong interest for <b>reinforcement learning</b> and <b>geometric data analysis</b>, two very closely related research fields that, I think, are milestones for achieving a general, context-dependant intelligence. My current coursework are about geometric deep learning, stopping times and online algorithm, geometric data analysis, convex optimization, reinforcement learningand computational statistics.

I am a former student researcher at the [Irving Institute for Cancer Dynamics](https://cancerdynamics.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University, under the supervision of [Dr. Simon Tavar√©](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=1aX_bIcAAAAJ&hl=en). My research interest focused on leveraging <b>CNN architectures</b> to produce informative summary statistics that facilitate the computation of posterior distributions for the parameters of <b>biological stochastic models</b>, utilizing state-of-the-art <b>Approximate Bayesian computation</b> frameworks.
