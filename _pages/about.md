ðŸ“— After having completed a Master's in Applied Mathematics at <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/">Ecole polytechnique (France)</a> as part of the engineer curriculum (X2021), I'm now in my final year of my graduate degree in Mathematics, Vision and Learning (<a href="https://www.master-mva.com/">MVA program</a>) at the <a href="https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/accueil-english/">Paris-Saclay University</a>.

ðŸ¦¿ I have a very strong interest for <b>optimisation algorithms</b> and their numerous applications in AI. My current coursework are about optimal transport, geometric deep learning, stopping times and online algorithms, geometric data analysis, convex optimization, reinforcement learning and computational statistics.
<br><br>
ðŸ§¬ I am a former student researcher at the <a href="https://cancerdynamics.columbia.edu/">Irving Institute for Cancer Dynamics</a> at Columbia University, under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=1aX_bIcAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Simon TavarÃ©</a>. My research interest focused on leveraging <b>CNN architectures</b> to produce informative summary statistics that facilitate the computation of posterior distributions for the parameters of <b>biological stochastic models</b>, utilizing state-of-the-art <b>Approximate Bayesian computation</b> frameworks.

ðŸŽ» I love music in general, but I particularly enjoy playing the violin since I am a child (I played in 4 different orchestras), and I am always happy to discover different musical repertoires. During my free time I enjoy running and cycling, or improving my skills at music games like DDR.
