ðŸ“— I completed a Master's degree in Applied Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence (<a href="https://www.master-mva.com/">MVA master</a>) at <a href="https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/accueil-english/">Paris-Saclay University</a> and a Master's in Applied Mathematics at <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/">Ecole Polytechnique (France)</a> as part of the IngÃ©nieur Polytechnicien Program (X2021).
<br><br>
ðŸ’¼ <b>Current Position:</b> Since September 2025, I am an <b>IngÃ©nieur-Ã©lÃ¨ve des ponts, des eaux et des forÃªts</b> - a trainee civil servant engineer as member of the French "Corps des IPEF" (French Ministries of Agriculture and Ecological Transition).
<br><br>
ðŸ”¬ <b>Research Experience:</b>
<br>
â€¢ <b>OIST, Japan</b> (April - August 2025): Research Assistant on <i>Neuroscience-Inspired Encoding and Learning: A Path to Robust Representation Learning</i> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.makotoyamada-ml.com/">Pr. Makoto Yamada</a> (Machine Learning and Data Science Unit). Explored frontiers between robust representation learning and neuroscience-inspired encoding and learning. Work accepted at <b><a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=3LERuKSX1B&referrer=%5Bthe%20profile%20of%20Mohammed-Yassine%20Habibi%5D(%2Fprofile%3Fid%3D~Mohammed-Yassine_Habibi1)">NeurIPS 2025 workshop</a></b>.
<br>
â€¢ <b>Columbia University, USA</b> (April - July 2024): Research Assistant on <i>Deep Learning and ABC for Parameter Inference</i> under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=1aX_bIcAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Simon TavarÃ©</a> (<a href="https://cancerdynamics.columbia.edu/">Herbert and Florence Irving Institute for Cancer Dynamics</a>). Inferred parameters of finite sites evolutionary models to fit them to specific cancer data, applying <b>Deep Learning frameworks</b> to summarize genomic data and <b>Random Forest Approximate Bayesian Computation (RF-ABC)</b> to infer multivariate vectors of parameters.
<br><br>
ðŸŒ± My research interests concern <b>representation learning, and self-supervised learning</b> and applications in ecology, and biodiversity.

ðŸŽ» I love music in general, but I particularly enjoy playing the violin since I am a child (I played in 4 different orchestras), and I am always happy to discover different musical repertoires. During my free time I enjoy running and cycling, or improving my skills at music games like DanceDanceRevolution.
